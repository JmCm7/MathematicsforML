# MathematicsforML
This repository was created during my course of Mathematics of Maching Learning, in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, at 2023-1. 

Here I will put the differents proyects and homeworks, that I will make during the course.

Currently, there are proyects about:

-Notebooks about Support vector machine in two different kind of problems

-Noebooks using five different kind of models to solve the previos problems

-A notebook about the solutions of some exercises from the book "Learning from data"

-A notebook working with "eigenfaces"
